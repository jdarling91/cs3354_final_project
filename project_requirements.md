Project Requirements:

1. Description: 
Please include the following in this section: 
- Title of your project 
- First name, last name of team members 
- Well described delegation of tasks, i.e. who did what in the project. Please make 
sure to fairly distribute tasks in the team and remember that in the end of the 
semester, each member of a team will receive the same grade. See grading policy 
below for more detail. 
- Project timeline: The steps you went through in the design and development of 
the project report. 
- A detailed description of your motivation (why you chose to do this particular 
project), where you expect your design to be used in real life. 
 
 
2. Duration and Cost Estimation: Based on Ch 9: Planning and Estimating Cost, 
include a detailed study of duration and cost estimations for your project. Please include 
the following items in your cost calculation: 
- Estimated LOC (Lines of Code). Please comment on the pros and cons of considering 
LOC as a measure of cost in software development. Suggest alternative cost measures 
and discuss their advantages over LOC measure (such as FFC metric, Intermediate 
COCOMO, etc.) 
- Estimated cost of hardware products (such as servers, etc.) 
- Estimated cost of software products (such as licenced software, etc.) 
- Estimated cost of personnel (number of people to code the end product, training cost 
after installation) 
 
 
3. Requirements Specifications: Based on Ch 10: The Requirements Workflow of the 
textbook, please specify what are the requirements for the system that you design. 
 
4. Use Case Descriptions and Diagrams: Using the role players in the requirements 
descriptions listed in item 2 above, describe use cases and actors in your system. Also 
draw use case diagrams for your design. You may find the descriptions mentioned in the 
document eLearning week3->IBM RSA example.pdf. It is a very comprehensive example 
on IBM Rational Software Architect. 
 
5. Class Diagrams: Based on the use case descriptions in step 3, please draw class 
diagrams for your design. The class diagram will realize the analysis step of the software 
lifecycle. For further details and examples, you may refer to Ch 11: The Analysis 
Workflow, and Ch 12: The Design Workflow of the textbook. You may also refer to the 
descriptions mentioned in the document eLearning week3->IBM RSA example.pdf. It is 
a very comprehensive example on IBM Rational Software Architect. 
 
 
6. Sequence Diagram: To schematically describe the timeline of events and message 
passings among your classes, draw the sequence diagram for each use case in your 
design. For further details, you may refer to Ch 11: The Analysis Workflow, and Ch 12: 
The Design Workflow of the textbook for examples. You may also refer to the 
descriptions mentioned in the document eLearning week3->IBM RSA example.pdf. It is 
a very comprehensive example on IBM Rational Software Architect. 
 
7. Publish your design to web: Please know that this needs to be a professional 
development, which requires design to be available for further reference on common 
shared media, such as web. So, please create a web documentation related to your project. 
You may also refer to the descriptions mentioned in the document eLearning week3-
>IBM RSA example.pdf. It is a very comprehensive example on IBM Rational Software 
Architect. 

 
8. Transform UML to an Object Oriented Program Skeleton Code: Use UML editor 
to automatically transform your UML design into an object oriented (such as Java or 
C++) code. Please know that as is, your code wonâ€™t execute after this transformation. It 
will require you to make more code additions, even further modifications. NO 
IMPLEMENTATION IS REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT. Still, realize this step to see 
transformation of the UML design into an object oriented program. You may also refer to 
the descriptions mentioned in the document eLearning week3->IBM RSA example.pdf. It 
is a very comprehensive example on IBM Rational Software Architect. 
 
9. GUI Design of your Screen Layouts: Include a visual representation of your screen 
designs that you plan to have in your implementation. 
 
10. Conclusion: Please make an evaluation of your work, describe any changes that you 
needed to make (if any), if things have deviated from what you had originally planned for 
and try to give justification for such changes. 
 
11. References: Please include properly cited references in IEEE paper referencing 
format. (You may see a referencing example in the sample IEEE paper in URL: 
http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf). YOUR REPORT DOES NOT 
HAVE TO BE 2 COLUMNS, IT CAN BE SINGLE COLUMN. ONLY REFER TO THE 
SAMPLE IEEE DOCUMENT FOR MODELING AFTER THE PROPER PAPER 
REFERENCING.) It means that your references should be numbered, and these numbers 
are properly cited in your project report.
